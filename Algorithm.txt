To design a state machine for a traffic control system for a 4-way road interchange, we can define the following states:

State L1: Lane 1 (Main Road) is active, and other lanes are blocked.
State L2: Lane 2 is active, and other lanes are blocked.
State L3: Lane 3 (Main Road) is active, and other lanes are blocked.
State L4: Lane 4 is active, and other lanes are blocked.
We can define the transitions between these states based on the given sequence and timing requirements. Here is a state machine diagram representing the traffic control system:

      +---------+
      |         |
      v         |
   +------+     |
   | L1   |     |
   +------+     |
      |         |
      v         |
   +------+     |
   | L2   |     |
   +------+     |
      |         |
      v         |
   +------+     |
   | L3   |     |
   +------+     |
      |         |
      v         |
   +------+     |
   | L4   |     |
   +------+     |
      |         |
      v         |
   +------+     |
   | Reset|<----+
   +------+

Here are the details of the state transitions and timings:

Transition from L1 to L2: After 30 clock cycles, L1 changes to red and L2 changes to green. This transition occurs after a clearance time of 5 clock cycles with both lanes showing red lights.
Transition from L2 to L3: After 20 clock cycles, L2 changes to red and L3 changes to green. This transition occurs after a clearance time of 5 clock cycles with both lanes showing red lights.
Transition from L3 to L4: After 30 clock cycles, L3 changes to red and L4 changes to green. This transition occurs after a clearance time of 5 clock cycles with both lanes showing red lights.
Transition from L4 to L1: After 20 clock cycles, L4 changes to red and L1 changes to green. This transition occurs after a clearance time of 5 clock cycles with both lanes showing red lights.


In the above Verilog code, the module TrafficControlSystem takes an input reset signal and provides output signals lane1, lane2, lane3, and lane4, representing the states of the lanes.


In the testbench, the reset signal is initially set to 1, and after 10 simulation time units, it is de-asserted to 0. The simulation continues for 200 time units before finishing. The always block displays the state of each lane whenever there is a change.

You can compile and simulate the Verilog code using a suitable simulation tool, such as ModelSim or VCS, to observe the behavior of the traffic control system.
